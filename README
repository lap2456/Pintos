Here is what we are trying to do:

The main function we messed with is syscall_exit in syscall.c. Compare what it 
used to be with what it is now to see differences. Our thought process is that we aren't sure
if and where we need to close directories and/or files within a directory. 

For some reason we are failing some userprog tests that create files with illegal file names 
(create_empty, create_long). We didn't have time figure out why we are failing these, so you should
start by looking at these and trying to fix them. We are also failing create_exists, and aren't sure why.
We think that these errors are caused because we aren't verifying name somewhere in filesys_create. 


Once you get past this, run some filesys tests that we are failing in VERBOSE mode and you will
see where our other problems are. Some things I know for sure:
 - In filesys_create our dir_add is not working (sometimes the ASSERT fails)
 - In filesys_create sometimes the ASSERT(dir!=null) fails after the call to get_this_dir
